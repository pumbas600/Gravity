# Gravity
 
A simple solar system simulator by implementing Newtons Law of Gravity into Unity, inspired by Sebastian Lague. You can his original video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7axImc1sxa0&t=484s&ab_channel=SebastianLague)

A video of it in action can be found [here](https://youtu.be/4C4_qpCBU9E)

You can head over to the wikipedia for more information about the MultiUnitObject class I designed.
